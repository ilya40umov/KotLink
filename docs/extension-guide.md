Namely, there are two options that need to be set:

* *KotLink Server URL* should be pointing to your KotLink server (e.g. `http://localhost:8080` 
in case if you are running KotLink server locally)
* *Extension Secret* should be set to your personal extension secret,
which can be found in UI under *Extension Secret* menu item.
