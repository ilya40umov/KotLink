KotLink is a solution for creating and sharing memorable URL aliases, 
which takes its inspiration from Google's internal Go-Links system.

### Why use KotLink?

* Get rid of bookmarks for URLs frequently used within your team
* Speak the same language as your colleges (e.g. Hey, can you check out what is happening with *staging&blank;grafana*?)
* Search your "intranet" quickly for a resource that you don't know the URL for

### Overview

KotLink works by letting people install a tiny browser extension 
that activates when the person first types **go** in the address bar and then presses **space**. 
While activated, the extension is providing autocomplete based on the database of aliases,
and after the user has hit **enter**, it will redirect the user to the actual URL that matches the provided alias.

For example, if someone has already created an alias for `vim shortcuts` 
that maps to `https://vim.rtorr.com`,
by typing *go&blank;vim&blank;shortcutsâ†µ*, the user will be redirected to the aforementioned link.

Please, also note that to use the browser extension, you first need to set up a dedicated KotLink server,
as it's going to store all of the links / namespaces for your team.

### Get KotLink In Your Browser

Install [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kotlink-browser-extension)

Install [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kotlink-browser-extension/cdkflkfieefihicjaidafmggjdnkakod)

To use KotLink with Vivaldi perform the following steps:
1. Go to Settings / Privacy and enable "Search Suggestions in Address Field".
1. Go to Settings / Search and make sure "Allow Search Suggestions" is checked for "In Address Field".
1. Also in Settings / Search, add a new search engine where:
  - *Name* is `KotLink` 
  - *Nickname* is `go`
  - *URL* is `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/link/redirect?link=%s`
  - *Suggest URL* is `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/link/suggest?link=%s&mode=opensearch&secret=YOUR_SECRET`

### Run KotLink Server Locally

KotLink server provides the backend for storing and resolving aliases, 
as well as UI for creating/editing them.

![List Aliases in UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilya40umov/KotLink/master/images/list-aliases.png)

For evaluation purposes, you can run KotLink server on your machine with the following commands 
(you may have to add `sudo` before all calls to `docker` depending on your local set-up): 
```
docker network create kotlink-network

docker run --name kotlink-postgres --network kotlink-network \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=kotlinkuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=kotlinkpass -e POSTGRES_DB=kotlink \
  -d postgres:9.6

docker run --rm --name kotlink-server --network kotlink-network -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://kotlink-postgres:5432/kotlink\
  ilya40umov/kotlink
```

Now if you open `http://localhost:8080/` you will be redirected to KotLink UI, 
which, after you have authorized with Google OAuth, will allow you to add namespaces and aliases.
At this point you can install Chrome / Firefox extension, open extension settings, 
where you will set `http://localhost:8080` as the server URL. 
Your personal extension secret can be found at `http://localhost:8080/ui/extension_secret`).

Please, note that to allow accessing KotLink UI under your custom domain name / IP address,
you will need to obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
and provide them to your KotLink server via environment variables 
(see more on this in [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md)). 
Through environment variables, you will also be able to restrict who can access your KotLink server.

When you are done evaluating, you can run the following command to **remove** KotLink network/database instance:
`docker rm -f kotlink-postgres && docker network rm kotlink-network`

For the detailed instructions on how to set up your own KotLink server on your Linux server or on AWS, 
take a look at the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md).
