KotLink is a solution for creating and sharing memorable URL aliases, 
which takes its inspiration from Google's internal Go-Links system.

### Why use KotLink?

* Get rid of bookmarks for URLs frequently used within your team
* Speak the same language as your colleges (e.g. Hey, can you check out what is happening with `staging grafana`?)
* Search your "intranet" quickly for a resource that you don't know the URL for

### Overview

KotLink works by letting people install a tiny browser extension 
(which is not even necessary in case of Vivaldi)
that activates when the person first types **go** in the address bar and then presses **space**. 
While activated, the extension is providing autocomplete based on the database of aliases,
and after the user has hit **enter**, it will redirect the user to the actual URL that matches the provided alias.

For example, if someone has already created an alias for `vim shortcuts` 
that maps to `https://vim.rtorr.com`,
by typing **go** `space` **vim shortcuts** `enter`, the user will be redirected to the aforementioned link.

Please, also note that to use the browser extension, you first need to set up a dedicated KotLink server
(see the instructions below).

### Get KotLink In Your Browser

Install [Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kotlink-browser-extension)

Install [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kotlink-browser-extension/cdkflkfieefihicjaidafmggjdnkakod)

To use KotLink with Vivaldi:
1. Go to Settings / Privacy and enable "Search Suggestions in Address Field".
1. Go to Settings / Search and make sure "Allow Search Suggestions" is checked for "In Address Field".
1. Also in Settings / Search, add a new search engine where:
  - *Name* is `KotLink` 
  - *Nickname* is `go`
  - *URL* is `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/link/redirect?link=%s`
  - *Suggest URL* is `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/api/link/suggest?link=%s&mode=opensearch&secret=YOUR_SECRET`

### Deploy KotLink Server

KotLink server provides the backend for storing and resolving aliases, 
as well as UI for creating/editing them.

### Engineering Guide

#### Required Software
* jdk 8+
* direnv
* docker
* docker-compose
* Intellij IDEA (recommended)

#### How To Develop Locally
* Start dependencies with `kt_env_up`
* Run application in Terminal with `./gradlew bootRun` (or in Intellij IDEA)
* Go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and create your namespaces / links
* Stop dependencies with `kt_env_down` (this command will also remove all data from postgres)
* Run the CI pipeline with `kt_env_ci` (can be run in parallel with application)

### TODOs
* implement generation of per-user extension secrets
* improve DB-related error handling
* add validation logic to namespace/alias service (e.g. default namespace should always be present)
* implement caching for the `/api/link/suggest` endpoint

* (Tech Debt) write tests for service layer
* (Tech Debt) address Codacy issues

### Next Phase
* add notion of owners for namespaces / links to restrict who can modify / delete what
* implement REST API to allow development of alternative UIs
