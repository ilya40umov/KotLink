KotLink is a solution for creating and sharing memorable URL aliases, 
which takes its inspiration from Google's internal Go-Links system.

It works by letting people install a tiny browser extension 
(which is not even necessary in case of Vivaldi browser)
that activates when the person first types `go` in the status bar and then presses whitespace. 
While activated, the extension is providing autocomplete based on the database of aliases,
and after the user has hit *Enter*, it will redirect the user to an actual URL that matches the provided alias.
For example, if someone has already created an alias for `staging newrelic` 
that maps to `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/YYY/applications/ZZZ`,
by typing `go` *Whitespace* `staging newrelic` *Enter*, the user will be redirected to the aforementioned link.

* CRUD REST endpoint for aliases
* implement caching of aliases
* Security (oath for all endpoints / secrets for autocomplete)
* vivaldi instructions
* chrome plugin
* firefox plugin
